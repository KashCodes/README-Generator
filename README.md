  ## Installation:
  🚨 You will need to export/download the code to you local machine. You will need to install Node.js. As well as the NPM Inquirer package. You'll need to use `npm init` to create your `package.json`. Then use `npm i inquirer` to install Inquirer package to your local application as these will not be downloaded.  Once installed you will be able to run the `node index` command in GitBash or your command line of choice. You will be prompted to answer a series of questions that will auto-fill the newly generated README.md file. You will then find your updated file located in the `./dist/README.md` location. It is important you fill out exactly what's being asked in each question so the links work properly and connect to your GitHub profile.

  ## Usage:
  🚀 This Node.js application uses the NPM Inquirer package to help users automatically generate their own professional `README.md` files. Once generated the file will include the title, a description, a hyper-linked table of contents, installation instructions (if any), an area to describe what the application should be used for, the license used for your repository application, a list of any additional contriubutors, what tests you should be able to run to troubleshoot, as well as contact information should someone have questions, comments, or concerns about your application/repository.
