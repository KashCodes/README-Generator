Automatically Formatted README Generator

README-Generator

This Node.js application will help Web Developers to automatically generate a formated `README.me` file for any application they may have created. 

You will need to export/download the code to you local machine. You will need to install Node.js. As well as the NPM Inquirer package. You'll need to use `npm init` to create your `package.json`. Then use `npm i inquirer` to install Inquirer package to your local application as these will not be downloaded.  Once installed you will be able to run the `node index` command in GitBash or your command line of choice. You will be prompted to answer a series of questions that will auto-fill the newly generated README.md file. You will then find your updated file located in the `./dist/README.md` location. It is important you fill out exactly what's being asked in each question so the links work properly and connect to your GitHub profile.  

This Node.js application uses the NPM Inquirer package to help users automatically generate their own professional `README.md` files. Once generated the file will include the title, a description, a hyper-linked table of contents, installation instructions (if any), an area to describe what the application should be used for, the license used for your repository application, a list of any additional contriubutors, what tests you should be able to run to troubleshoot, as well as contact information should someone have questions, comments, or concerns about your application/repository.
